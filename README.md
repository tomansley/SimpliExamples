# Simpli Integration Manager Example Repo

This repo helps Simpli Integration Manager developers go from zero to a working extension.

## Part 1: Install the Simpli Integration Manager

The first thing to do is install the Simpli Integration Manager from the AppExchange. This code will not work without the app installed.

## Part 2: Explore the Simpli Interface App

Once the app has been installed in an org open the Simpli Interface app to explore the example configurations and tabs. There is a Start tab explaining the basics of what the app is all about. The Describe tab allows the user to select a configuration and view its properties including its attributes and children. The Process and Batch tabs allows the user to take configurations for test runs.

## Part 3: Extending the App
If it looks like the app will almost do what's needed but not quite and an extension is necessary then this repository of examples will help you get there. There are empty shell classes which can be cut and pasted. There are basic Hello World examples using the SimpliFrameworkObject and SimpliFrameworkBatch interfaces. And there are examples showing more comlex usage with configuration.

## Part 4: Reaching Out
The Simpli integration manager takes a bit of time to get to grips with. But once up and running it provides great power to build quick transactional integration end points If you need help understanding concepts, configurations or extensions then don't hesitate to reach out to me - tomansley@gmail.com. Instruction and demos can also be provided as necessary.
